# CS660 Project 2

For project instructions and goals please see the [assignment document](CS660-71425-Fa-2024-Project-2.pdf) this document will focus on our groups approach to coding the solution, and how we plan to collaborate.


### Helpers
This repo has been initialized with 4 helper sub-modules, these modules should contain the majority of code that we write for this project.

Note that each helper directory contains an __init__.py file, this file tells the python interpreter that the directory should be treated as a module, much the same way that numpy or sklearn are. If the code written for the helper requires any initialization steps, they should be coded in the __init__.py file.

For more on __init__.py files please see:
[Geeks for Geeks breakdown](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-__init__-py-file-in-python/)
[Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)



These modules will then be called from our presintation.ipynb file.

Working with the code this way will allow us to effectively review and utilize each others code.
