# Project #2-Creating helper functons to compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Matrix, Primary Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition of those Eigenvalue and Eigenvectors

## Project Overview
-This project has been assigned for CS 660-Mathematical Foundations of Analytics at Pace University, as part of the Masters in Data Science program. We are attempting to create original helper functions to computer eigenvectors, eigenvalues, Primary Component Analysis and Singular Value Decompositions of a matrix. Once we complete this, we will compare the efficiency of our work to scikit-learn's helper functions.
